1. Display the order key, customer name, part name, supplier name, order date and extended
price for each selected item.

select L_ORDERKEY, O_ORDERDATE, L_EXTENDEDPRICE, C_NAME, P_NAME, S_NAME
from STAR_LINEORDER left join STAR_CUSTOMER on STAR_LINEORDER.O_CUSTKEY = STAR_CUSTOMER.C_CUSTKEY
	LEFT JOIN PART ON STAR_LINEORDER.L_PARTKEY = PART.P_PARTKEY
	LEFT JOIN SUPPLIER ON STAR_LINEORDER.L_SUPPKEY = SUPPLIER.S_SUPPKEY
WHERE O_CUSTKEY < 1000 
	and L_PARTKEY < 1000
	and L_SUPPKEY < 1000
	and O_ORDERDATE < TO_DATE('1994-12-31', 'YYYY-MM-DD');

2. Display the total sum of the extended prices for each existing combination of customer
region, customer nation and customer market segment.

select STAR_CUSTOMER.R_NAME, STAR_CUSTOMER.N_NAME, STAR_CUSTOMER.C_MKTSEGMENT, SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE) 
from STAR_LINEORDER left join STAR_CUSTOMER on STAR_LINEORDER.O_CUSTKEY = STAR_CUSTOMER.C_CUSTKEY
	LEFT JOIN PART ON STAR_LINEORDER.L_PARTKEY = PART.P_PARTKEY
	LEFT JOIN SUPPLIER ON STAR_LINEORDER.L_SUPPKEY = SUPPLIER.S_SUPPKEY
WHERE O_CUSTKEY < 1000 
	and L_PARTKEY < 1000
	and L_SUPPKEY < 1000
	and O_ORDERDATE < TO_DATE('1994-12-31', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
GROUP BY STAR_CUSTOMER.R_NAME, STAR_CUSTOMER.N_NAME, STAR_CUSTOMER.C_MKTSEGMENT;

3. Pricing Summary Report Query (A modification from TPC-H Query 1)
Create a pricing summary report page that reports the amount of business that was billed,
shipped, and returned. The Pricing Summary Report Query provides a summary pricing
report for all lineitems. The query lists totals for the extended price, discounted extended
price, discounted extended price plus tax, average quantity, average extended price, and
average discount. These aggregates are grouped by year and month of the order date and
listed in ascending order of year and month. A count of the number of lineitems in each
group is included.

4. Order Priority Checking Query (A modification from TPC-H Query 4)
This query determines how well the order priority system is working and gives an assessment
of customer satisfaction. The Order Priority Checking Query counts the number of orders
ordered in which at least one line item was received by the customer later than its committed
date (receiptdate > commitdate). The query lists the count of such orders for each order
priority sorted in ascending priority order.
